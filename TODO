finish writing the harness for writing tests for typechecker
make your list of tests
write smart tests --- it's ocaml, you only have to test a few base cases
refactor code for readability.... please
figure out how to use ocamldebug
implement FindEscape
handle functions w/ more than k params
break statements are still kinda ugly (meh I'll fix it while writing the IR)
