write good, unit testcases
write print/testing infrastructure
refactor code for readability.... please
make the func_names/var_names printing more elegant
figure out how to use ocamldebug
implement FindEscape
handle functions w/ more than k params
break statements are still kinda ugly (meh I'll fix it while writing the IR)
