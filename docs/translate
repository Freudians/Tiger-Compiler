best way to generate code fragments is probably to propogate a list of 
code fragments throughout each of the translate functions
Each new string/function declaration adds a code fragment
declarations inside of function declarations may also add a code fragment 
the final, outermost exp generated will be turned into a code fragment as well

While you're at it, for testing purposes, define expty to return Translate.exp Option
instead of Translate.exp. Replace all returns of unit with None in order so that 
we can test code as it is run.
